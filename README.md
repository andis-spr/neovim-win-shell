![Screenshot demonstrating 'Edit with Neovim' Windows Explorer directory right click context menu item and Neovim Qt being associated with various text files.](https://i.imgur.com/SE9ia2U.png)

Set Neovim Qt as the default text editor on Windows (Explorer file associations, file & directory context menu item).
## Setup

Clone this repo locally and put the full path of your `nvim-qt.exe` executable as the first line of `nvim-qt-exe-path.txt`. Optionally â€” edit the list of file extensions that will be associated with Neovim Qt in `file-associations.txt`.

It's advised NOT changing `.bat`, `.cmd`, `.vb` and `.vbs` file extension default program associations as it will override Windows file opener default actions for these files, breaking various third-party scripts.

Then run the `nvim-qt-win-shell-ADD.bat` script as administrator to
- register Neovim Qt `ProgID`
- register Neovim Qt file associations
- add the `Edit with Neovim` file and directory right-click context menu item

Be aware that on the first run this script downloads ZIP archive of the [`SetUserFTA`](https://kolbi.cz/blog/2017/10/25/setuserfta-userchoice-hash-defeated-set-file-type-associations-per-user/) utility executable from the author's homepage, saving it in the same directory. It is extracted and run in the script for adding the file associations to Windows Registry.

## Removal
Run the `nvim-qt-win-shell-REMOVE.bat` script as administrator to
- unregister Neovim Qt `ProgID`
- unregister Neovim Qt file associations
- remove the `Edit with Neovim` file and directory right-click context menu item
