![Screenshot demonstrating 'Edit with Neovim' Windows Explorer directory right click context menu item and Neovim Qt being associated with various text files.](https://i.imgur.com/SE9ia2U.png)

Set Neovim Qt as the default text editor on Windows (Explorer file associations, file & directory context menu item).
## Setup

Clone this repo locally and put the full path of your `nvim-qt.exe` executable as the first line of `nvim-qt.exe-path.txt`.  Optionally â€” edit the list of file extensions that will be associated with Neovim Qt in `file-associations.txt`.

Then run the `nvim-qt-win-shell-ADD.bat` script as an administrator to
 - register Neovim Qt `ProgID`
 - register Neovim Qt file associations
 - add the `Edit with Neovim` file and directory right-click context menu item

## Removal
Run the `nvim-qt-win-shell-REMOVE.bat` script as an administrator to
- unregister Neovim Qt `ProgID`
- unregister Neovim Qt file associations
- remove the `Edit with Neovim` file and directory right-click context menu item

## General information

 - **Please be aware that on the first run `nvim-qt-win-shell-ADD.bat` script downloads a third-party [SetUserFTA](https://kolbi.cz/blog/2017/10/25/setuserfta-userchoice-hash-defeated-set-file-type-associations-per-user/) utility ZIP archive from the author's homepage**, saving it in the same directory. It is then extracted and ran in the script for adding the file associations to Windows Registry.

- It's advised NOT changing `.bat`, `.cmd`, `.vb` and `.vbs` file extension default program associations as it will override Windows file opener default actions for these files, breaking various third-party scripts.
